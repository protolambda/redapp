# Changelog

## `v[next]`

*Please collect changelog nodes here,
 these will be included in the changelog entry for the next release.
 
## `v1.2.1`

- Bugfix, TXs receipts were retrieved incorrectly from the state.

## `v1.2.0`

- Pre-fill receipt input when created locally for faster feedback. 
 I.e. `transactions[myId].receipt.input` will always contain `data` (hex encoded string) from transaction call if any data was added to the TX.

## `v1.1.0`

- Fixed an issue in TX processing where TX_FINAL was not fired,
 TX_SUCCESS was incorrect, and post-0-confirmation TX_RECEIPTS where ignored.
- TX status can now be 'pending': i.e. it has a receipt, 
 but the receipt doesn't tell the block-number, as it has not been mined yet.

## `v1.0.0`

Initial release.
