# Example projects

ReDApp provides a few example projects, for demo purposes and as a full implementation reference.
Try them!

## React Example

The React/Redux mix is very common, hence an example to use ReDapp with React.

A live demo can be found here: https://redapp.protolambda.com/examples/react-example/

- Load contract interfaces and interact with them (powered by redapp in the background).
- Track accounts, from both state collections: 
`local` (i.e. added by you using the gui), and `wallet` (e.g. your active metmask account)
- Track blocks
- Track log-events (coming soon in redapp V2)

## Minimal example

This is the example you want to check out if you just want to use redapp on
 a very minimal NodeJS project, which can be easily adopted to your own redux setup.

The minimal example can be run from CLI.
